About Me
I love hiking, reading sci-fi novels, cooking, and playing chess, and I’m always exploring new technologies. My journey in the tech world began when I discovered my fascination with computers in high school. I started by building simple websites and gradually moved on to more complex projects, eventually landing my first internship at a local tech company.
